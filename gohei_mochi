Grilled Rice Cake with Sweet Miso Sauce (Gohei mochi)
Source: https://washoku.guide/recipe/406900

Ingredients

Uncooked sweet sticky rice (or uncooked regular rice) 2 rice cooker cups (about 360 ml)
Miso 6 tablespoons
Mirin 6 tablespoons
Sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons
White sesame seeds 3 tablespoons

Instructions

1. If you are using sweet sticky rice, cook in a rice cooker using slightly less water than you would for regular rice. Mix the ingredients until smooth.

2. Lay the freshly cooked rice on plastic wrap. Lightly press into an oval shaped rice ball while molding it around a stick. Use disposable chopsticks or Popsicle sticks.

3. Grill both sides for about 1 ~ 2 minutes over medium heat until they're brown. Use a spoon to coat each side with the sweet miso mixture, and grill for another 1 minute on each side. Wrapping the stick with aluminium foil will prevent burning.

Helpful hints
The miso mixture burns easily, so adjust the heat and grilling time accordingly. You can also use walnuts instead of sesame seeds. The cooking methods and shape of the rice cakes might differ in different areas. I created this recipe so that people can make this dish at home.
