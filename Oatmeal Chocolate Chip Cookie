We enjoyed this recipe. Make sure to read down on the directions, because there are a couple of forgotten ingredients that she gives the measurements for.

Added some cinnamon and a few more choco chips and this recipe is legit! Dark pans use less time fyi

Very good cookies!! I love how they are crispy on the outside and soft and moist they are in the center of the cookie!
