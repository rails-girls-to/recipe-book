Serves: 1

Ingredients
1 beet, rinsed, lightly peeled and quartered
1 apple, peeled, cored and quartered
1 Tbsp size piece of fresh ginger (skin removed)
3 whole carrots, rinsed and peeled
unfiltered apple juice (optional)

Instructions
Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth, adding a splash of apple juice if needed to get it moving. I probably added about 1/4 cup.

Then, place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and pour the juice over. Use a rubber spatula to press the pulp down and squeeze all of the juice out. Let stand for 5 minutes so you get most of the juice.

Discard pulp and pour your juice into a serving glass. Drink immediately or chill for a bit. Will keep in the fridge for a day or so, but will taste best when fresh.
